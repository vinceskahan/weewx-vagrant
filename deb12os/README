This installs a debian12 only 
for Vagrant using Parallels as the VM app on a m1 mac mini.

The intent is to support random testing from a known baseline
so the provisioner script is empty.

The same Vagrantfile should work on Intel if you change the
config.vm.box to any recent debian-based os of your choosing
and change the provider to virtualbox (typically).

For apple silicon users - the image name here is a Parallels
base image I built using the excellent 'bento' tool.  See
the toplevel README for details
