This installs weewx v5 using pip as a non-privileged user
for Vagrant using Parallels as the VM app on a m1 mac mini.

The same Vagrantfile should work on Intel if you change the
config.vm.box to any recent debian-based os of your choosing
and change the provider to virtualbox (typically).

This hard-codes the default vagrant user 'vagrant' in
the provisioner script. For running other than in vagrant
you'd likely want to lightly edit provision.sh to set your
desired username

For apple silicon users - the image name here is a Parallels
base image I built using the excellent 'bento' tool.  See
the toplevel README for details
