This installs weewx v5 using dpkg
for Vagrant using Parallels as the VM app on a m1 mac mini.

The same Vagrantfile should work on Intel if you change the
config.vm.box to any recent debian-based os of your choosing
and change the provider to virtualbox (typically).

The provisioner script should work on any weewx system
running the dpkg of weewx.
